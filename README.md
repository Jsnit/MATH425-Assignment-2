1. Grade Point Average (KNNL Problem #2.23 on page 93): The director of admissions of a small college selected 120 students at random from the new freshman class in a study to determine whether a student's grade point average (GPA) at the end of the freshman year (Y) can be predicted from the ACT test score (X). Assume that simple linear regression is appropriate.

2. Muscle Mass (KNNL Problem #2.27 on page 93): A person's muscle mass is expected to decrease with age. To explore this relationship in women, a nutritionist randomly selected 15 women from each 10-year age group, beginning with age 40 and ending with age 79. The results follow; X is age, and Y is a measure of muscle mass. Assume that first-order regression model is appropriate.
